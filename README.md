# EurorackChordSequencer
This project describes my built of a modular synthesizer 8-step cv sequencer module in the Eurorack format.
The module is an extension of the sequencer module from @TimMJN , making use of an Arduino Nano.

You can check the GitHub project from @TimMJN here:
http://github.com/TimMJN/Arduino-Sequencer

There are a few changes to the original design:
- Extension to 3 individual CV outputs for controlling chords
- Switches for each of the 8 steps to control a gate signal output for each step
- In planning: quantization of CV outputs (see details below)

A demonstration video is existing on YouTube.

## Arduino Firmware
The code for the Arduino Nano is taken from the sequencer project from @TimMJN .
I created a new version, which includes a simple chromatic quantization of all 3 CV outputs.
However, I could not yet test that version of the module, because I would need a multi channel DAC, the MCP4728, a quad 12-bit DAC.
That IC is currently not available, I assume due to the global IC and microchip shortage.
I will update this page with the new firmware and schematic, as soon as I could purchase a chip and test the changes.

Big thanks to @TimMJN !
