# EurorackChordSequencer
This project describes my built of a modular synthesizer 8-step cv sequencer module in the Eurorack format.
The module is an extension of the sequencer module from TimMJN, amkimg use of an Arduino Nano.

You can check the GitHub project from TimMJN here:

There are a few changes to the original design:
- Extension to 3 individual CV outputs for controlling chords
- Switches for each of the 8 steps to control a gate signal output for each step
- In planning: quantization of CV outputs (see details below)
